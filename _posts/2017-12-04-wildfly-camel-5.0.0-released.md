[WildFly Camel](https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-camel) [5.0.0](https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-camel/releases/tag/5.0.0) is now available.

This release represents a major milestone in the WildFly Camel project. After much hard work, the majority of the 250+ Camel components, data formats and scripting languages are now supported.

You can view the latest [road maps](https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-camel/tree/master/catalog/src/main/resources) to see which components are supported, planned or rejected.

This release also upgrades two major core components to their latest versions. WildFly 11.0.0.Final and Camel 2.20.1.

Enjoy!
