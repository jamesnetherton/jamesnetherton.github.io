Yesterday I had the pleasure of giving a talk at the [London JBoss Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/topics/jboss/gb/17/london/) on Java Microservice development
with Apache Camel. It went down pretty well (despite running short of time).

The slides can be found [here](https://github.com/jamesnetherton/presentations/blob/master/jbug-camel-microservices.pdf) and the demo application code [here](https://github.com/jamesnetherton/camel-microservice-demo).
