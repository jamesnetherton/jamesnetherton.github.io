Sometimes you may want to use custom or third party Apache Camel components in your Camel Quarkus project.

If you add the component dependency to your project, you may find that when trying to use its endpoints that you encounter
`FailedToCreateRouteException`, as your custom endpoint could not be found.

Fear not! The resolution is (usually) quite simple. Your custom component requires a [Jandex](https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/) index so that
Camel Quarkus can discover it and work its build time optimization magic.

## Indexing your component

Some options to index your component are as follows.

### 1. Maven plugins

You can create a Jandex index for your component JAR with the `camel-component-maven-plugin`.

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-component-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${camel.version}</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>generate</id>
      <goals>
        <goal>generate</goal>
      </goals>
      <phase>process-classes</phase>
    </execution>
   </executions>
</plugin>
```

The `generate` goal will create a Jandex index automatically. There's more information about the plugin in the [documentation](https://camel.apache.org/manual/camel-component-maven-plugin.html).

Alternatively, you can use the `jandex-maven-plugin` instead.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.smallrye</groupId>
    <artifactId>jandex-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${jandex.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>make-index</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>jandex</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

### 2. Quarkus automatic Jandex indexing

If you cannot modify the component project to add Jandex indexing, then Quarkus can do it for you on-the-fly with some
additional configuration in `application.properties`.

Replace `my-custom-component` with the Maven `artifactId` of your component.

```
quarkus.index-dependency.my-custom-component.group-id=org.acme
quarkus.index-dependency.my-custom-component.artifact-id=my-custom-component
```

### 3. Custom Quarkus extension

Unless you specifically want to target native mode compatibility for your component or generally want to make use of Quarkus build time optimizations, then one of the
above two options should suffice.

Otherwise, you can create a custom Quarkus extension for your component. The process for creating an extension is covered extensively in the Quarkus [Writing Extensions Guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/writing-extensions).

## Other potential problems

### Camel service discovery

I mentioned above that a missing Jandex index is usually the cause of custom components not working on Camel Quarkus. Another potential issue is
if the component makes use of Camel service discovery. E.g if there are some custom services defined under `META-INF/services/org/apache/camel`.

The core set of
services automatically included by default are defined [here](https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/blob/main/extensions-core/core/deployment/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/quarkus/core/deployment/CamelProcessor.java#L150).
If your component uses a service not covered by those paths, then you'll need to add some additional configuration to your application.

For example, if you had a custom service defined under `META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/my-custom`, then you can add the following to `application.properties`.

```
quarkus.camel.service.discovery.include-patterns = META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/my-custom/*
```

### Native mode compilation / runtime issues

If you choose to compile your application to a native executable, you may find that your component does not work as expected. The native compilation may fail, or you may encounter
problems at runtime.

Some typical failures are due to classes that need to be registered for reflection. For that, you can use the `quarkus.camel.native.reflection.include-patterns` configuration property. Or if the
component is loading resources from the classpath, those resources need to be embedded within the native application. To do that, you can use the `quarkus.native.resources.includes`
configuration property.

More complex native mode issues may require you to consider [writing a Quarkus extension](https://quarkus.io/guides/writing-extensions). for your component.

## Conclusion

Hopefully this brief overview helps to get your custom component working with Camel Quarkus. Feel free to [contact](https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/new/choose) the
Camel Quarkus team with any issues and we'll try to resolve them.

Happy coding!
